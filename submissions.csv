"It is already and established fact that applying open data principles is not about a “read only” approach to data, but also involves creating engagement and conversations around open data which thus leads to actionable decisions. While citizens are given the power to access open data, now more than ever, there is a great need to identify how a culture of Data Visualization and Graphical Discovery Analysis will further accentuate the power in the entire open practice.

Looking at today\\\'s burgeoning social media ecosystem, internet penetration, and the increase in use of mobile devices, it is pertinent to also find innovative ways to deliver open data so as to deliver simplified data swiftly and build conversations in a more civic friendly environment. This thus signifies the need for capacity building programmes that will equip individuals with Data Visualization, Graphical Discovery Analysis and Design skills to engage and simplify already open data using tools or rather develop flexible open source software/tools which can be used to simplify and visualize open data.

This changes how we look at open data, we see a scenario where most of the job has been done for us, where time has been saved and all we just need is look upon already visualized open data to easily see cause effect-relationships, trends, connections and thus make our informed decisions thereafter.","(1)action

"The communication on a data-driven economy published on 2/7/2014 by the European Commission is the main inspiration and context for this “Data-driven Public Services” proposal.
The basis for this concept is a system of interconnected Official Registers orbiting in a Data Governance framework maintained and shared according to the Classifications assigned to their contents; to support the public administration processes used in the delivery of both internal and external government services.
The following is a three-tier grouping of these registers which if not already part of the legislation should be given the necessary legal basis in order to support the delivery of public services in an efficient and customer centric manner.
• Data Governance Registers
• Foundation Data Registers
• Line-of-Business Registers
Three different methods for the storage and updating of these Official Registers may be considered depending on the type and purpose of the content and records involved;
1. Local storage and updating of the entire contents of an Official Register by one or more Roles in a line-of-business / peripheral data repository and process,
2. Central storage and updating of the contents of an Official Register by various Roles using shared facilities on the basis of record filtering enabling only the owner Role to update specific records while the other records are not accessible and may be invisible,
3. Federated updating of distinct parts of the same Register using different local storage repositories; which adhere to the same structure and are maintained using the same updating process; with the possibility to virtually aggregate the entire contents as one Official Register;
The contents of all these Registers need to be described through metadata which is standardized across the different domains as regards the core elements with other optional describing data on the basis of the type of Register.
The minimum or core elements of the metadata shall also include agreed and standard records that describe the type of access and updating performed known as audit trail.
The full spectrum of enterprise data interconnected services is built around a central Data Governance body and an Enterprise Data Management and Stewardship operational structure as follows;
• Authorization and Authentication
• Official / Accredited Data
• Identity Management
This proposed new paradigm is captured in the pictorial showing the main components of the information framework for a data-driven public services delivery system.","(1)action

"The first national conference of Open Government and Open Data was held in Morocco on May 6th, 2014. This event was organized by the Moroccan E-Governance Association for Development (AMGED) with the participation of different parties (Administrations, private sectors, WB, UNESCO, ODI and NGOs), concerned with public open data in Morocco. This event initiated other initiatives and competitions organized by AMGED, and aiming at attracting talented developers to build applications that use government data: the Open Data National trophy, and the Diplomatic hackaton (DiploHack) respectively in collaboration with ODI, and the Netherlands embassy in Morocco.
Despite all the efforts made by the civil society and the government in Morocco, the full benefits of Open Data are still far from being reached. More than ever, it requires specific and relevant capacity development programs focused on using open data both to achieve open government goals, and to enhance sustainable Development through new value-added data based products.
On the other hand, national Digital Government Strategies are increasingly designed for openness from the start by making Open Data the default for government IT systems. Therefore, capacity development programs in this field should be carried out into a holistic and well defined framework for the development of consistent Digital transformation of the Government.
This imperative can be considered as a major principle for the building process of the competency map encompassing the different clusters of skills, knowledge, and abilities that are required to successfully implement open data initiatives.
Applying this principle, a team of academics (Professors at National School of Computer Science and System Analysis , ENSIAS-Rabat) in collaboration with AMGED, elaborated and launched the “e-Government and Digital Transformation of the Administration” university diploma. It is in an executive training program aiming at enhancing awareness and knowledge on Digital Transformation of Government topics, from an open data based perspective. The proposed curriculum is composed of action-based training modules, dealing with different digitalization levels (strategic, organizational, technical, financial and legal), while focusing on demonstrating and highlighting the potentials, benefits and hurdles of using Open Data to promote innovation, sustainable development, transparency and accountability.
The target audience of this program can be both technical and non-technical staff, be they Governmental policies experts, Directors of electronic and smart governments, open data program managers and similar positions in government, civil service, private sector and other organizations.
Our aim to participate to the IODC Summit, is to present and discuss this experience, and see how far its findings can contribute, as required by the IODC community, to deliver greater open data capacity, and especially to build an open data competency map.","(1)action

"In November of 2015, OpenDataSoft published a global catalog of 1600+ open data portals as a list (https://www.opendatasoft.com/a-comprehensive-list-of-all-open-data-portals-around-the-world/), downloadable data set and API (http://data.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/open-data-sources%40public/export/) and standalone map website (http://opendatainception.io/).

The opendatainception.io map site received 17,000 visits in its first four months, in addition to thousands shares and tens of thousands of interactions on social media. Open Data Inception also received countless contributions from the community for its improvement: geo-localized data were improved, portals were added, and dead links were fixed.

It’s clear from this response that there’s strong interest in making open data easier to find and use, but there are challenges to doing so that we hope the international open data community can help us address:

• Can we create standardized metadata for open data portals so that portal metadata, and existing dataset metadata, can be used to create a specialized search engine for locating data of interest worldwide? (There’s already a metadata schema for datasets, but not for portals themselves; one option to explore is a variation of the file ‘robots.txt’ specifically created for Open Data portals)
• Can we develop a way to create links between related open data portals to aid discovery?
• Can we use the OpenDataSoft API framework in the Open Data Inception portal to one day not only locate, but consume data from multiple portals through one access point?

In addition to these issues related to standards and interoperability, our interactive session will also touch on strategies for simply making the existing list easier to use and navigate.

Note: For background information about the methodology used to build the list, see https://www.opendatasoft.com/2015/11/02/how-we-put-together-a-list-of-1600-open-data-portals-around-the-world-to-help-open-data-community/.","(1)action

"Standardization is a main goal to achieve at the Open Data community. To unlock the full potential of open data, we have to assure that all of us are talking the same language. This means that, literally, we need to talk the same language. So, for Aragón Open Data, standards is a key topic to step on to other actions. We are trying to improve our dataset\'s standards working in the 3 ways that IODC\'s roadmap established: 1. Strengthen and prioritize good practice recommendations; 2. Build connections among open standards; 3. Fostering awareness and use of common standards.

To achieve this target we are managing a mix of actions that will lead us to provide access to data, independently of the infrastructure where data are stored or how the data are managed. This process is being addressed by several procedures that we want to implement universally in our data structure. These procedures can be summarized in 3 main actions that can be developed as independent layers:

1. Universal connection to databases (developed). We are able to connect to every dataset of the government, independently the legacy where the data is stored. We have created connectors to different databases that exist commercially: Oracle, PostGre, MySQL, SQL Server, SOLr. This is the first principle, universal access to every data that could be stored in the Government

2. Common vocabularies (on going). We are developing some common vocabularies to implement in the government databases to understand what data mean. We have already made/implemented some semantic vocabularies as the one we use in territorial data or the one we are using for statistical data, But the important issue is that we are widening this strategy to the core vocabularies that we are using in the Aragón Government

3. Universal API to query data (developed). We have developed a universal API that allows querying for a single cell in every dataset. This is the way that allows the best reuse and consumption of information. Every IT developer could ask only for the particular data wanted, in order to provide to users the most accurate and personalized service

So, Aragón Open Data strategy on standards is going a step beyond in the state of art, as we are fostering a full Open Data platform to work with data. Aragón Open Data as a platform aims to be able to offer every single data as they are requested by users. To develop this strategy, standards are essential in order to allow everybody:
• Access the data
• Access to well defined data
It is essential for re-users to be agnostic about governments\' infrastructure and governments\' language, so we are acting to promote a wider point of view of standardization that involves the data user\'s point of view","(1)action

"The 2015 roadmap identifies among the activities to be done in terms of international collaboration the need to address good practices and open standards. In the context of the Spanish network on Open Data and Smart Cities (www.opencitydata.es), a group of Spanish academic institutions has been working on the provision of the technology and organisational support for the development of common data structures, vocabularies and ontologies for the generation of homogeneous datasets and APIs across cities in the world. This has resulted in a set of vocabulary development tools based on GitHub (including Ontoology, WIDOCO, Oops!, Jarsomatic), which are all connected together to help during the whole lifecycle of open data vocabulary development, as well as an active GitHub organisation (github.com/opencitydata) which is now giving support to the OpenData100 initiative (which has been submitted as a call for sharing for IODC2016).
A potential talk or session around this idea may present the work that has been done, the tooling that is made available for this purpose, and how it has been effectively used for the Spanish OpenData100 initiative in order to develop the vocabularies that will be published at http://vocab.linkeddata.es/datosabiertos","(1)action

"One of the very important part of Open data is a technical support and way how to use data, once they are open and accessible. Each institution is trying to resolve this issue in its own way, creating different applications, interfaces etc. allowing end users to actually use their open data for their own purposes. The idea which would make all this much easier, is to build unified platform ( Open Data Interface Unified Platform ) which will address two sides : institutions and organizations who has open data available, would be able to create interfaces ( Web Services ) and to allow all other users to access these data, and on the other side, all potential users ( technical and non-technical ) which will consume these data using standardized Web Services and use it for their own purposes.
The benefits of this approach are :
- Single access of point for many different open data sources
- Standardised way of using / accessing open data
- Involvement of wide community of developers
- Accessibility to many different users and institutions
- Possibility to analyse usage of open data","(1)action

"CityBikes is the largest open API providing bike sharing information for more than 400 cities all around the world. We are usually regarded as an \""open data\"" project, assuming we are using and re-using open data sources. Less than 10% of our feeds come from open data sources. The remaining 90% is composed of a mix of scraping websites and unlicensed machine-readable feeds.

Over the last few years there has been a progression by transportation companies and city councils toward providing their information as open data. Most city councils agree and talk about the grand future of open data, Directive 2003/98/EC encourages EU member states to release information regarding public services and yet in most cases there’s little action in enforcing Public Private Partnerships (PPP) to release their public information under a non-restrictive license or even to transfer ownership of the data to the city council to be included in their open data portals.

Even with the increasing number of companies and institutions interested in participating in open data, by no means should we consider open data a reality or something to be taken for granted. I firmly believe in the future and benefits of open data, I have seen them happening all around CityBikes, but as technologists we need to stress the fact that the data is not out there yet, even though we know how to circumvent it.

"In the Infomediary world, the economic financial sector is not directly represented on
the provisional list of Open Data Areas. We propose to speak about the importance of
this sector and the generation a specific area that’s oriented around the business world
(Open data for business information), in which the Public Administration manages the
data as a source for creating new products and infomediary services, concerning
solvency, business risk management, trends, perspectives, SWOT (Strengths,
weaknesses, opportunities and threats), economic value, sources etc. Using a
comparative worldwide view.
In other countries, how does the facilitation of greater transparency in the market work?
Is the reuse of tax, registration, or other data held by public administrations in an open
format permitted?
We propose to reflect the value of open data in this area to commercial traffic and the
best way is to measure the infomediary sector. Are there studies like the which of
ASEDIE that measure the value of infomediary sector in other countries? It would be
interesting to see the evolution worldwide.
From our point of view, we see that this area is not only linked to every other area but
is an integral part of their growth. This area is also of vital importance in the prevention
and/ or control of Criminal Offences (money laundering, terrorist financing, corruption)
fraud prevention. Highlighting the Safety and prevention tools.
This area by contextualization, debugging and analysis creates confidence, commercial
security and economic development. Justifying the existence of this area and easiness
of opening public sector data to improve commercial traffic. The impact session will
focus on the impact with concrete examples that this area has had in the business world

"Nowadays, many governments are (or have the intention of) publishing thousands of open data sets, according to it s own standards and procedures. The quantity of applications based on Open Data is increasing. At the moment, there are no international standards to specify the formats of the data sets from Open Data bases, therefore it causes a variety of formats of data.
To build data integration processes is a must to put together all kind of formats. Some of the best universities and research centers are already developing software tools to give support to the inte-gration process (e.g. Data Tamer, Data Wrangler at MIT and Stanford Universities). The problem with these tools is that they need data scientist interaction to take part in the integration process as a final step. We propose to develop a system able to avoid dependency of a data scientist, based on the similarity within environmental data and by developing processes that can be automated by programming.
The main idea is to build Map Reduce procedures adapted to data sources per each government in order to achieve an automated integration. Research groups can then share their work and put available the results to the society.
As example, our work focus in environment data like temperature, energy consumption, air quality, solar radiation, speeds of wind, etc. Since 2 years, the government of Madrid is publishing its Open Data bases relative to environment indicators in real time. In the same way, other governments have published Open Data sets relative to the environment (like Andalucia or Bilbao). All of those data sets have different formats. Our solution is able to integrate all of them, furthermore it allows the user to make and visualize some analysis over the real-time data. Once the integration task is done, all the data from any government has the same format and the analysis process can be initiated in a computational better way.","(1)action

"In 2012, NYC signed into law one of the most forward thinking open data laws in existence. This law outlined three key components: that government must proactively disclose data though a single data portal, the community is an integral part of defining standards, & that agencies must prioritize data release that fosters agency accountability, increases public knowledge, furthers the agency\'s mission, creates economic opportunity, or is responding to public need.

Since then, advocates & a new municipal administration have collaborated to improve the law. These seven new laws outline a framework for plain language data dictionaries, universal geographic/cartographic standards, strengthening oversight & enforcement, ensuring that archival datasets are accessible, & the City is more responsive to community demand.

At the heart of this effort is Gale A. Brewer. As Council Member, she spearheaded the introduction & passage of the City\'s open data law. Now, as the Manhattan Borough President (MBPO), she oversees how this data is integrated into the fabric of the City.

In 2014, the MBPO brought in City University of New York to expose Community Boards to open data practices. This experiment lasted six months. In the first three months, students received an informal civic education. For the last three months, students were sent into the field only to have Manhattan Community Boards express a need for a formalized program.

For 2015, MBPO sought out a partner in curriculum development. This led the MBPO to partner with BetaNYC to co-develop a curriculum & internship program that improves public participation with Manhattan\'s Community Boards.

Established in 1963, the City’s 59 Community Boards oversee land use issues, budget recommendations, & service delivery. However, because each one is run by two full time employees & 50 volunteer representatives, they struggle to engage effectively with evolving technology & open data. In a political environment where a variety of stakeholders, such as real estate developers, are already empowered, this project attempts to level the playing field by improving decision making.

This is a multi year program. In this first year, we are performing a gap analysis on three verticals: digital footprints/social media, data/analytics, & office technology/meeting design. In the following year, we will outline best practices for increasing civic participation & future trainings.

To date, we have established a free, modular, & reusable open data curriculum that demystifies government technology, & trains youth how to use open data. This curriculum is focused on enhancing basic digital literacy skills, using \""off the shelf\"" mapping tools, & acquiring open data. Currently, our program is mentoring 11 undergraduate students to work in real world environments & allows Community Board members to move toward data-driven decision making–currently embraced by NYC government, but lagging in effective implementation.

Our program proactively attracts undergraduate youth looking to be involved in careers in civic data, technology, design, & community leadership. Another long term goal is to have these individuals join their local Community Board or consider a career in Municipal Government. We see this program as building 21st century literacy, & want to ensure future generations are fluent.","(1)action

"Holding free elections is essential to representative democracy and is a major pillar of the current liberal democratic systems. Free and fair elections allow citizens exercise their right to political participation by choosing between competing parties and establish democratic institutions through the election of representatives who will be responsible for taking political decisions.
In this context, the electoral processes constitute the public space where citizens and political parties establish a social dialogue to address issues of common interest. During election campaigns, political parties are trying to get their electoral message to the largest possible number of voters, through different channels and formats to achieve their vote. Specifically, the election manifesto is the key element from the three components which are distinguished within the electoral message (party, candidate and manifesto). Political parties’ election manifestos are party policy statements which set out their reading and analysis of reality, interpretation and identification of current problems; and, if applicable, show their determination in proposing solutions. Therefore, manifestos occupy a unique position as the sole authoritative statement of the policy of a party in an electoral process. And show how political parties perceive their priorities and strategies for government action in the short and medium term.
In addition, election campaigns are not only an instrument in the service of political parties, but are also at the service of citizens voters. Thus, election campaigns are an opportunity for societies to discuss their specific situations and reflect on the future they want to build. Moreover, the election manifestos provide citizens with first-hand information to discriminate the alternatives and the consequences of their choice. Ultimately, manifestos may be useful for choosing \""good policies\"" and political parties that support them.
The ‘quality’ of this decision process depends on the ability of the general public to understand the information collected by political parties in their electoral programs. However, the characteristics of this type of document (large volume of information, absence of a common structure, multiple meanings or predominantly verbal nature, among others) may hinder access, compression and interpretation by the public.
Our proposal involves setting a citizen-centred standard for election manifestos. We believe that a structured and standardized format for policy manifestos might allow citizens to identify the issues addressed and non-addressed, by political parties in the electoral programs, analyse their content, establish policy positions on the issues addressed or compare and make connections between different manifestos. In short, this standard might improve understanding of the position of political parties competing regularly to get the vote of the electorate. The latter is vital to promote accountability across political parties; an essential element of effective democratic systems and one of the basic principles of good governance. Undoubtedly, it is an important empowerment tool to achieve an active, well-informed and responsible participation of citizens in politics.","(1)action

"We start by discussing the concept of platform, and experiences of platform in technology world and its relation to governance. Then we reach to GaaP (Government as a Platform). By studying countries experiences, we learnt lessons which can help us design a coherent policy framework helping governments avoiding confusions during their policy making. Then by reviewing previous experiences, we will try to define a policy framework, for policymakers interested in the GaaP, to make better related policies. This policy framework will feature world class attempts, and is adaptive to different sociopolitical systems. Items such as open data standards, crowd-based diagnosis and data-driven policy making and being easy yet functional and innovative, are of the main items in this framework. This framework tries to be a “public platform” for policy making toward GaaP. Finally, using the introduced framework, we will try to provide a sample policy paper for Iran, as a country with new challenges and opportunities after the JCPOA (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action).

"Big data has had a similar growth that sustainability for the last 15 years. In the widely named “society of the information” the big and open data, going together with transparency, ethics and compliance, has to allow the companies to be more sustainable and responsible of how they perform.

My goal of this session would be to have an open conversation about in which ESG aspects (Environmental, Social and Governance – including ethics and compliance -) the open (and inclusive) data can push the companies and the society to reach a really sustainable path. I would love to be in the table sharing good practices, opinions, predictions with other professionals. I think it would be very interesting for the people. It would be great to talk about which initiatives could boost the sustainability, which ones would be the barriers.

Sustainability and Corporate Social Responsibility needs the big and open data to reach the next level, to help companies in its performance.
Open data allows customers to make better decisions about what they buy. If the customer or client has more information about the companies, it would be able to make more responsible decisions based on more accurate information.

This is my idea and I am thankful to share it with you. I just wanted to let you know that if you pick up my idea and you invite me I will work hard in everything you need.

I just wanted to end with a little description of myself. My name is Daniel Lois, I am Master Civil Engineer a master in Corporate Social Responsibility and another one, ongoing, in big data and business intelligence. I have worked for companies like Repsol and KPMG. Nowadays I am working as sustainability senior consultant in PwC Spain and, from my field, I am working with open data solutions that help us to provide better recommendations for the companies.","(1)action

"In many cases, the Territorial Open Data movement was initiated and begun to take shape from Bottom-Up processes (implications and requirements of associations, people networks, digital companies, researchers ... ).
Moreover, among the sources of the major difficulties in the development of open data mechanisms, the issue of policy and decision posture seem , especially in France, far from being resolved. We propose an approach to consider the conditions of the interessement of policy makers and we propose to develop the capacity of these to become facilitators in the ecosystem (which pre-exists them).
This raises the question of construction of the knowledge of these actors. This led to the development of a capacity for strategic thinking and policy towards digital data.
In a concrete political assemblage, (complex) and because techno-political dynamics are increasingly differentiated, and because policies are increasingly polycentric, it is appropriate to question the place of those who self-positioning themselves as experts in public data (producer and former owners). This is should be related with the creation of skills and trades (chief data officer for example) and with the emerging professionalization .
We will address these issues through the analysis of a training course (in higher education) created in France about “Territorial Innovation and digital data”. We will advocate for the synergy of these long training systems and research on a European scale.","(1)action

"Resource directory data — i.e. information about the health, human, and social services available to people in need — is hard to find. In large part, this is because it’s also hard to maintain, since agencies that provide such services might not have strong incentives to attract new people through their doors. Yet this is one of the most important kinds of civic data. It is sought not just by people in need, but also by service providers of all kinds (such as social workers, librarians, teachers, healthcare providers, etc) — as well as researchers, policy-makers and funders, who need resource data as a key input in analyzing population health, community needs, and resource allocation patterns.

The Open Referral initiative has convened a network of hundreds of stakeholders from around the world, representing diverse perspectives on this complex problem. Together, we’ve developed an open data specification that establishes interoperability among different kinds of resource directory information systems — by establishing a \'bridge\' between legacy data standards and emerging web standards. Now we are developing an ecosystem of open source tools that help people connect with services.

In this session, we’ll discuss the strategic framework for Open Referral and explore some of the implementations to date (including pilots in the US, the UK, Canada, Spain, the humanitarian crisis response field, and beyond). We’ll dedicate a significant amount of time to identifying key questions and action areas for the path ahead, and break out into participatory subgroups that will generate a set of resolution statements and next steps.

"Our call to action is for the international community to more comprehensively report data on their development finance activities, particularly in reporting values in the IATI ‘value-added’ fields. These fields will play a crucial role in measuring financial flows to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and catalyzing a data revolution for sustainable development. We argue that a subset of these fields -- namely: DAC sector code, results/indicators, and geographic coordinates -- are of critical importance in the SDG era due to the cross-cutting nature of our new global goals.

In the coming years, data will play a central role informing decisions about development policy, coordinating actors in the international development space, and paving the way for a true revolution in sustainable development. Data standards are essential in this process, as they provide the framework and shared language for situating, evaluating, and ultimately using these data. Within the context of development finance data, the OECD-DAC’s Creditor Reporting System (CRS) and the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) set the international norms and benchmarks for data quality and availability. These twin pillars in open data and aid transparency have galvanized development partners, NGOs, and partner countries to make data on financial flows more readily accessible and actionable for the development community.

In an era characterized by ambitious global agendas and ever-expanding priorities, the CRS has been stretched to its limit as a standard for reporting open aid information. It lacks timeliness as its data releases lag almost a year. It struggles with adaptability, due to an inability to easily incorporate new schemas and vocabularies into its rigid framework. And finally, it is weakened by its lack of inclusivity. The CRS only tracks ODA flows at a time when aid is occupying a diminishing share of the total resource envelope.

The IATI Registry’s more inclusive, adaptable and timely approach offers a resolution to the CRS’ shortcomings. However, IATI faces its own share of problems as it lacks a compliance regime. That is, IATI data remains under-reported and lacks a rigorous verification process that would allow it to be joinable with other datasets. Particularly in regards to the former, ‘value-added’ IATI fields are woefully underreported by the majority of reporting organizations. Visibility on these fields could facilitate crosswalks between sector vocabularies to sustainable development targets/goals, allow stakeholders to analyze individual projects/activities, and provide insight into potential sub-national variations in SDG funding and progress. Given the current reporting environment, the international community needs a paradigm shift in their view of these fields. With widespread compliance, they can become the foundation to usher a meaningful data revolution to better understand and affect development outcomes in the era of sustainable development.","(1)action

"This proposal is proposed jointly with Carlos Iglesias (Web Foundation), Barbara Ubaldi (OECD) and James McKinney

How can we measure open data, together, to achieve better results, foster the discussion and broaden the understanding of OD implementation, use and impact.

By “together,” we mean engaging a broad set of actors of the open data ecosystem including government officials and domain experts who may not already be engaged in open data: for example, engaging a water quality NGO to identify the data elements and metadata elements that serve real use cases and evaluate those for quality.

This approach would engage key data providers (e.g. governments) and more real consumers of open data – not just those who identify themselves as part of the open data community. This approach, based on engaging new users, can also serve the purpose of helping governments in the prioritization of datasets release and of fostering usage of open data.

An approach based on the idea of measuring ,“together,” with a more cooperative and iterative relationship with the entities being measured can help producing tools and design processes to help governments deliver better impact, instead of simply ranking governments independently.

This session will be in a format of a *panel* that may include the following questions:
* What do stakeholders want to see in measurements?
* How do we reach out to the different stakeholders?
* How do stakeholders use data?
* What is the goal of the measurement?
* How to address local/regional particularities?

"As an activist, always ready to help and invite those wanting to participate in fostering integrity and preventing corruption which are essential to promoting good governance, maintaining public confidence in government and public decision-making, and supporting societal well-being and prosperity. Ensuring transparent transactions and a clean business environment in the private sector is as important component of a country’s overall anti-corruption strategy. Efficient and competitive companies ensure healthier markets and greater investor confidence.
Furthermore, clean companies that do business with governments can place an effective check on both private and public sector corruption. Effective mechanisms to disclose wrongdoing without fear of reprisals are at the heart of integrity in both business and government. If integrity is upheld at the core of an organization\'s inner workings, and if concerns are discussed freely and there is no fear of persecution, then silence in the face of wrongdoing and adversity will no longer be the status quo in sub-Saharan Africa.
My motivation for submitting this proposal is to collaborate, modify approaches, learn new skills and develop capacity on ways to support whistle-blower protection as the ultimate line of defense for safeguarding the public interest during the International Open Data Conference.
Protecting whistle-blowers promotes the culture of accountability and integrity in both public and private institutions, and encourages the reporting of misconduct, fraud and corruption.
I am an activist who is strongly advocating the culture of good governance among Africa States and the need for the protection of whistle-blower so as to contribute to an environment of trust and tolerance which result shall be the enhancement of capacity to respond to wrongdoing and matters of public concern.
One big challenge we face in sub-Saharan Africa is the lack of developing a climate of openness and integrity that enables effective whistle-blower protection in Africa.
We can learn more from each other when information is open. A free exchange of ideas is critical to creating an environment where people are allowed to learn and use existing information toward creating new ideas. When we are free to collaborate, we create. We can solve problems that no one person may be able to solve on their own. Rapid prototypes can lead to rapid failures, but that leads to better solutions found faster. When you\'re free to experiment, you can look at problems in new ways and look for answers in new places. You can then learn by doing.
In a meritocracy, the best ideas win. Everyone has access to the same information. Successful work determines which projects rise and gather effort from the community. Communities are formed around a common purpose. They bring together diverse ideas and share work. Together, a global community can create beyond the capabilities of any one individual. It multiplies effort and shares the work. Together, we can do more.
At the end encourage Africa countries to develop review mechanisms to identify data, benchmarks, indicators relative to whistle-blower protection systems and the broader integrity framework in order to evaluate effectiveness and monitor performance.","(1)action

"As civil servant, working for the last ten years in public Administrations close to politicians as legal advisor, I \'m not really sure that we know how to boost and convince politicians to foster Open data.
We all are convinced about the benefits of OD to become more transparent, solve public problems, create opportunities, empower citizens and improve governments...but are we sure that this is exactly what the politicians, as decision-makers, are looking for?
Are those achievements going to benefit them and their particular career aspirations?
To be honest, I can say that, mostly (not all), politicians want to get high popularity and be reelected and, by the way, improve government to the people.
It could seem a pessimistic opinion but, finally, the politician use to work to get good results for himself and his party...so if we are able to show them how Open data can help to achieve those goals and getting good results to help them to be well-considered, be sure that they are going to foster and support OD. Otherwise they won\'t make enough efforts to set OD.
It is not just a question of convincing that “Transparency is good”. Of course it is but…more than this…It is a question of paying attention to Open Data by politicians as a good way to improve themselves and their careers. In this way we can be sure that developing Open Data, and its benefits, will be guaranteed.
Is anyone able to show strong arguments to convince politicians to foster OD? Could you share them with us? This is a very important task we must try if we want to succeed to establish OD in public administration all over the world. This is one of our main challenge we have to face: showing strong arguments to convince politicians to foster OD and have their attention.
Remember they are the ones who decide how to spend the budget and what initiatives support or not....They are our “target”. The main customer to make Open Data initiatives get real.
I guess this is why we all are doing so many efforts to show the real impact of open data. To show its importance and benefits to the citizenship.
But, furthermore, in this way I would propose to discuss about the different ways we can make politicians, as decision-makers in Public Administration who must consider to develop and boost open data projects or not, and set those arguments as to help Open Data become strong, real and expand to many countries and public administrations.
This is an opportunity to learn how to show the benefits of Open Data to decision-makers for everyone interested in OD. The context is all over the world where there are Public administrations headed by politicians and that is as well the importance to discuss it, where anyone can share its knowledge and real experience about it.","(1)action

"The goal of this action is to identify, study, and categorize initiatives that combine OGD with digital tools (e.g. smartphones, social networks, sensors, etc.) and non-digital participatory practices (e.g. public consultations, citizens\' juries, self-organized participation).
The action will contribute to document efforts whose key aim is to empower citizens. It will focus on how OGD and other tools affect knowledge transfers and lead to more egalitarian decision-making. In other words, it will investigate whether and how OGD is helping citizens to uphold their role as effective stakeholders in local policy-making.
In my theoretical model, knowledge transfers within and across the public sector (PA) and civil society (CSO) depends on the degree of participation. When no participation occurs, knowledge flows internally (within PA) but not externally (between PA and CSO) until policies are finalized. In staged participation scenarios – such as public consultations and citizens\' juries - citizens can provide their input on policy proposals. However, institutions decide a priori when and how citizens participate.
In self-organized participation, on the other hand, the proactive sharing of public sector information leads to engagement in all levels of governmental activities. Citizens can: 1) provide feedback on how data is collected and published; 2) develop more informed opinions on policy issues because they access similar information as public planners; 3) create apps and services to improve the public\'s offering; 4) monitor policy implementation and results; and 5) gather their own data to enrich overall understanding of social issues.
To test whether the presence of OGD creates the knowledge transfers discussed above, and its impact on decision-making processes, I will compare initiatives located in cities that share key characteristics (e.g. size) and in which participation occurs in similar policy domains (e.g. urban planning, environment, transport) but where OGD supply differs.
Focusing on local urban contexts where participation happens with or without OGD will serve three purposes: 1) it will investigate the actual impact of OGD on participation and egalitarian decision-making; consequently 2) it might show avenues to introduce OGD to wider audiences that are engaged in participatory actions but have not considered the potential of open public information; and 3) it will contribute to research advocating for investment in OGD-related efforts.
I plant to study initiatives that originate both as governmental projects (top-down) and spontaneous citizen-led action (bottom-up). Available theoretical concepts – e.g. deliberative democracy and social movements theories – may help frame some of the elements observed. However, it is important to keep an open perspective as the dynamics underlying OGD-fuelled participation might display novel characteristics.
Discussing the project with the IODC community would help to: 1) identify initiatives across the world that may comply with all or some of the characteristics discussed above: 2) challenge the theoretical model against practical experiences; and 3) identify a preliminary set of best practices and institutional and cultural influences.","(1)action

"Jakarta Smart City is an initiative that aims to provide integrated information hub of Jakarta. In becoming such, it requires the government, agencies, and all of its work units to disclose their data. In return, Jakarta Smart City also uses crowdsourcing as method of gathering data from the citizens. This practice is particularly done through public reporting tools that are integrated with Jakarta Smart City: Qlue, Waze, and @petajkt. The research that we conducted on Jakarta Smart City found that this initiative, to some extent, has succeeded in bridging government and its units with the citizen though data “exchange”, where citizens can access government data and government can gather data from the citizens.

However, the research found that citizens’ participation is limited to the act of reporting and reporting is not even the main usage of the tools for majority of the citizens who use it. Most of the users are passive; they use public reporting tools mainly to gather information or reports that are provided by other users for their interest. In this light, we understand that 1) citizens are the main providers of data for the tools as well as the main consumer for the said data, and 2) citizens contribution is limited in the form that is less favorable by the citizen.

This finding provokes thought of how the data circulated among citizens can be processed to create contributions that is more meaningful. Adopting information seeking as the activity that most users do, the research offers a recommendation of innovation inside the application in order to build capacity of the citizen. This innovation entails providing information on how citizens can help directly when there are phenomena that are reported by other citizens. This way, the user of the tools can choose to not just gather the information of the current condition or situation, but also information of how they can help if they are in the vicinity.","(1)action

"The open access movement largely in digital humanities builds upon a particularly Western idea that all knowledge or information can be known and held, a tenet critiqued and addressed by Kim Christen. Her work with Australian Aborigines demonstrates the possibilities of limiting openness, of moving cultural knowledge into a digital space but also contextualizing and obscuring access to parts of those materials, balancing preservation and the possibilities of extraction. In using data, open and otherwise, to work towards a more just and equitable world, particular attention has to be paid to the innovations and rights of indigenous peoples, as well as histories with researchers. Data sovereignty and the OCAP principles (First Nations Information Governance Centre) articulate the self-determined right of indigenous nations to decide the best course of action for data by, from, and with their citizens or tied back to their polities, including specific and distinct actions of ownership, control, access, and possession (OCAP). Extractive research across a vast range of peoples and fields of study has occurred over time, and it is imperative that the move to open data does not perpetuate this inequitable and limited work.
To that end, this presentation will review the challenges (historical and ongoing) between researchers and indigenous peoples through cases such as Havasupai vs. Arizona Board of Regents, grave robbing, and unauthorized publication of creation stories. The comparison of open data, for example in a medical information commons, as a “shared resource” drawing heavily upon European and American political philosophers regarding “proper” land use, reiterates the need for other models and evaluation of the benefits and costs (including for whom in both analyses) of open and sovereign data systems. Further, this presentation will introduce a wide range of opportunities, especially partnerships with indigenous nations and peoples that honor data sovereignty, contribute to ongoing education and capacity building, and can therefore lead to richer data and analyses than an unmediated commons. To engage another set of models, this presentation will turn finally to the research regulation that has been ongoing throughout the globe by indigenous peoples, spurred further by Linda Tuhiwai Smith’s Decolonizing Methodologies, particularly how those research protocols address the use of biospecimens from their physical removal (such as through a blood draw or cheek swab) and to the conversion of that physical biosample into data.
This presentation intends to describe the implications of past efforts and the opportunities that we are poised to engage today, but to fail to recognize the past is to repeat it, or have it repeated on the bodies, information, and lives of the peoples. The larger IODC meeting will benefit from the attention paid to alternative structures, so that in building a roadmap for open data, the inequities of the past (and their structural mechanisms) are not recreated for the future.","(1)action

"Many governments (and some private organizations) publish data via portals. Although this approach has been the preferred one by most organizations, it leads to several problems. First, the data is spread across multiple datasets, in ways that may make sense for the producers, but not necessarily for citizens. Second, the data is not always updated and there are little incentives for the data stewards to keep them up to date. Third the data is delivered with a focus on developers most of the time (say, as CSV and JSON files), leaving non-technical citizens abandoned, with the hope that a technical good samaritan can process the information for them. All of the above result in an offer of data with too many \""bugs\"" to make it usable for the main population.

We believe that the efforts related to data delivery should be focused on a more citizen-centric approach: For that, we propose the use of a data storytelling focus, aligned with the organization\'s objectives and mission. These stories can cover the main aspects of the organization\'s activities. A data storytelling approach has multiple benefits:

- First, a good narrative can focus on what citizens are most interested.
- Second, it simplifies the communication of the data via a more linear narration, instead of leaving users on their own in front of dozens (sometimes hundreds) of datasets.
- Third, a good story will make use of multiple datasets, that help to cover
- Fourth, an outdated story reflects outdated data, making it easier for citizens to demand more data from the government organizations.


For example, a Department of Health could present a story of health quality over the last decades. This is something important for the public and it is not available in any specific dataset. The story can include number of beds and doctors available, vaccination rates and mortality statistics per region over the years. This story can also be linked to another story showing the improvements in efficiency and coverage of the health system in the last years. Such stories can be composed of text, visualizations and other media, along with links to the raw, original datasets provided in the data portals.

We believe the use of storytelling techniques can be an important complement to Open Data portals. Data storytelling simplifies the communication of complex, distributed data and delivers a data-supported message to a wide range of stakeholders.","(1)action

"The information systems of public institutions play a crucial role in how we collectively look at and act in the world. They shape the way decisions are made, progress is evaluated, resources are allocated, issues are flagged, debates are framed and action is taken. As a United Nations (UN) report recently put it, “Data are the lifeblood of decision-making and the raw material for accountability.”

Every information system renders certain aspects of the world visible and lets others recede into the background. Datasets highlight some things and not others. They make the world comprehensible and navigable in their own way – whether for the purposes of policy evaluation, public service delivery, administration or governance.

Given the critical role of public information systems in public life, what happens when they leave out parts of the picture that civil society groups consider vital? What can civil society actors do to shape or influence these systems so they can be used to advance progress around social, democratic and environmental issues?

This session will look at steps that can be taken to make public information systems more responsive to the interests and concerns of civil society. This includes through initiatives to change existing forms of measurement, to advocate new forms of measurement and to undertake new forms of measurement with the intention of changing what and how public institutions count.

The session will be convened by Open Knowledge International (http://okfn.org), a global civil society organisation which has played a significant role in advancing open data around the world through a combination of thought-leadership, community building and software development.

Open Knowledge International will outline its commitments and showcase its work towards participatory design methodologies for public data infrastructures as well as activities to leverage civil society data projects (such as Open Spending and Open Trials) in order to shape official data infrastructures.

Drawing on recent research in this area and practical experience of participants, the session will aim to contribute to setting the agenda for this critical area of innovation for open data initiatives around the world. Examples would be drawn from a recent white paper on “Changing What Counts” (undertaken as a collaboration between Open Knowledge and CIVICUS), as well as ongoing attempts to shape data infrastructures around the beneficial ownership of companies and the global data infrastructure for the taxation of multinational companies.

While the International Open Data Charter and the UN Data Revolution have mainly focused on the potential of opening up data, we believe that this agenda will be vital to ensuring that public data systems are relevant and responsive to the concerns of society and can be used effectively to secure advances towards important societal goals.

It will be highly relevant for a range of other action areas, including the Charter, data standards, measurement and capacity building.

"Data holders often wonder why reuse does not happen overnight when a new data portal is launched with a number of datasets. Open data policies are looking for actions that can be designed to foster reuse and wealth creation based on open government data.

There are a number of areas that have to be tackled and a number of roadblocks to be removed: formats, value of datasets released, licenses are only some of them. But one that has been less discussed is the well-known question: How far should a public administration go with regard to the provision of services based on open government datasets?

The discussion in the context of fostering open government data reuse, arise from the difficulties of finding a balance between the services that every public administration must provide to citizens for free and the space that should be left for private initiatives to create value from open government datasets. In many cases, that unstable balance creates certain tensions that do not contribute to innovation.

The arguments both from the supply and the demand side are diverse. These arguments show positions from one end: “public administrations should only provide raw data and no services;” to the opposite: “the public administration should go forward in the value chain as much as possible when providing services to citizens.”

My position in this matter is that it is not useful to put any effort in drawing a red line between what should be considered a basic/core service and a premium/value-added service. Quite on the contrary, we should work on the definition of the minimum incentives that should be designed for opendata-driven innovation to flourish and deliver wealth creation.

For that reason, I propose the following statement, which could be a starting point to clearly define the minimum conditions that a reuser needs to create value added services:

“open government datasets should be released in such condition that a reuser can build the same services that are provided for free by the data holder.”

This is basically because, in many cases, value creation starts from that baseline; this is, from just improving a service that already exists. If an existing public service cannot be reproduced, for example due to a few hours delay in the release of the underlying dataset or because of the limited quality of the released data, then it will not be possible to innovate by launching and improved product or service to the market.

This approach to the issue can help us make some progress in this debate. I hope this first statement can be improved and better worded by contributions from the community, or otherwise proved wrong by evidence or better arguments than my own.","(1)action

"One of the great promises of the open data field was to open public budgets so arm-chair accountants would scrutinise public expenditure, pinpointing bad expenditure or corruption. Evidence so far shows that such scenario did not materialise. In this session we explore the challenges and benefits of releasing open data and building civic tools based on use cases. In particular we explore the Uruguayan budget and show the process that lead Uruguayans to open their budget. Also we explore the process to build open tools for several stakeholders. The session seeks to engage a wide range of public authorities and civil society advocates to reflect on the practice of opening budgets and using it for several good governance purposes.

This session will be developed by Diego Gonnet or Gabriela Delfino (Planning and Budget Office, Uruguay) , Manuel Aristar[an and Fabrizio Scrollini with inputs from global partners such as GIFT","(1)action

"The value of the public data being made available for reuse is becoming increasingly acknowledged not only by the private sector but also by the public entities that generate them. For this reason, more and more public entities are creating their own open data spaces in which to gradually expand the volume of information being made available to reusers. However, each one is an independent consultation point with descriptive and technical information on the data sets they contain. They lack a common standard framework. This situation - i.e. numerous unconnected projects - has been highlighted repeatedly by the Open Data Community, which has been calling for a single information access point.

In response to this request the International Open Data Charter has stablish several recommendations in this respect, highlighting these items: publish data on a central portal, so that open data is easily discoverable and accessible in one place, and ensure that open datasets include consistent core metadata and are fully described.

In this regard, in Spain, efforts are now being made within the framework provided by the Aporta Project, the national initiative of the Spanish Government for promoting the Re-Use of Public Sector Information (PSI) and fostering the open data culture among the Public Administration and the Society. Among them, the following should be highlighted:

- The creation of a legal framework on data reuse which informs each entity of its duty to publish public data and make that data available for reuse, and provides guidelines for doing so.
- The drawing up of technical standards to establish common conditions for: the selection, identification, description, conditions of use and making available of data sets - the Technical Interoperability Standards on the Reuse of Information Resources (NTI Standard)
- The permanent enrichment, thanks to a federation tool, of a central portal - the National Catalogue of Reusable Public Information (datos.gob.es), enabling that open data is easily discoverable and accessible in one place and also the existence of a global view that shows a general overview of the PSI reuse in Spain.

These three main activities are closely related, and have a common feature. All of them are developed taking into account international guidelines: Spanish legal framework has been developed according to the European Directive on the re-use of public sector information, NTI Standard is an Application Profile of the Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT) of W3C, and the central portal has been built up ensuring harvesting metadata from the Spanish National Catalogue into the Pan-European portal.

Our proposal in this context is to foster a participatory discussion to share how useful it is to engage with domestic and international standard bodies to encourage increased interoperability between existing open data initiatives. In line with what is stated in the Open Data Charter, we are committed to the creation of common, global data standards where they do not already exist, and ensure that any new data standards we create are interoperable with existing ones.","(1)action

"It is known that the implications for organisations making data open will create significant business opportunities and make institutions more accountable. The IEEE, a global body representing technology professionals, have embarked on a process (\""Industry Connections\"") to begin building a standard for the provision of dependable and systematic Open Data by governments and companies.

At present, there is a considerable amount of attention given to data. For example Sir Tim Berners-Lee believes that in 2016 an Open Data Charter will be created. Furthermore, the Open Data movement fits into Open Government, Smart Cities and Big Data. Part of our activities will be to ascertain how these different initiatives interrelate.

This initiative will address Open Data from three key perspectives:
* Open does not mean All. Personal Privacy and Security needs to be central in an Open Data standard
* Open does not imply Free. This is a reprise of Richard Stallman’s refrain that one should think of “free” as in “free speech,” not as in “free beer”.
Open has political implications which we seek to avoid. This initiative should not get stuck on hard political issues.

In furthering the intention to create a Standard around Open Data, we will be working closely with organisations who have already made a significant contribution to Open Data. It is our intention to be specific in our initiative and assist local government to make data available in an open scalable and dependable way.

The beneficiaries of an Open Data standard will be:
entrepreneurs, who will get sustainable access to data to create useful service
big companies, who will be able to facilitate local government’s data needs
local governments, who will be able to enhance their services
local companies, who will be able to find better resources through better access
local government, who will get taxable revenue streams
society, who will benefit from openness

The above list of benefits is not exhaustive. The benefits of a universal Open Data are significant and profound.

The following deliverables for this Industry Connections program are proposed:
Identify and recruit a diverse set of participants from local governments and institutions to discuss their challenges and needs with regard to managing their data.
The initial participants and focus will be in South Africa and based on a Use Case of SA local government, with the intention to expand the project at the earliest opportunity.
A report that summarizes the related initiatives and proposes ways to unite and harmonize these initiatives.
A formal proposal for one or more Open Data standards to the IEEE Standards Association.
Help in the definition of Open Data.
Proposed standards would need to be consistent with the many data processes and models, various IEEE data standards and related standards.
There are a multitude of software tools for Data Analysis. The proposed standard should help users choose the correct ones.
A proposal for a Proof of Concept as a reference implementation for a local government Open Data standard.","(1)action

"ABSTRACT
Government leaders, data scientist and analysts today have more data than ever at hand to make smart and structured decisions. This information comes from various sources, including social media, sensor data, financial transactions and open-source data. However making sense of such massive amounts of data is an extremely challenging task. As a result, data is often not used to its full potential. How to handle the overflow of this kind of information will be the next challenge of the 21 century.
Governments around the world are struggling to determine and define a new authoritative \""identity\"" to fundamentally change the way public services are perceived and provided through a variety of innovative middle and long term action plans under a citizen-centric approach, which should combat corruption, foster a customer-care culture, enhance access, as well as increase of readiness, efficiency and competitiveness in the public administration and in the whole marketplace. The innovative and pervasive use of technology is fundamentally transforming how people is doing business and living their daily lives.
But technology by itself is not enough to become a power user. Some more complex activities occur when a our mind is blowed in the middle of a hurricane of information flows. Some of the concepts involved are : the Perceived eReadiness Model (PERM), the Perceived Organizational eReadiness (POER) and the Perceived External eReadiness (PEER). Exponential increases in computing power, the rise of high-speed networks, and the growing mobile revolution have put the Internet at our fingertips, encouraging innovations that are giving new opportunities to citizens. We must not be only end users now, but we need to become power users. To make this happen we should enhance our attitude towards an upper human condition called HSP, to trigger the spark of a further emotional interaction and shift into the mental states of transitions. Mobile devices will become wearables more like nano robots with endless computing power, recognizing each other devices and sharing strategic information for real time decisions in the upcoming era of IOT. There will be no waste of time and no time to wait for smart decisions. We will live in a continuous predictive environment scenario. It will be important to focus on a new vision and generate an open big data culture based on the deep impact of the dynamics of the economic, environmental and social change occuring in communities worldwide. EGov Metrics is an innovative training programme oriented to raise the capacity building of central Governments and organisations to capitalise on Open Big Data and adding strategic value. An important key factor of EGov Metrics is to experiment and develop smart mobile applications, which can meet user needs. The Leadind Unit of EGov Metrics is proposing to work inside a \""cluster\"" to create a local open big data culture around open data services – decentralising innovation by encouraging start-up communities and beyond to experiment and innovate with open data, engaging with the wider city and leading to the creation of new business models and new high tech services.

"City of Helsinki has been, and still is, the leading Finnish city in open data activities. Until recently, other major cities in Finland have taken much smaller steps in open data activities in their regions. However, the ongoing spearhead project of the six largest cities makes a considerable effort to bring all cities to the same level in the open data field. As opposed to the other cities in the project, the city of Turku has put a lot of emphasis on the co-operation between different open data actors within the region.

One of the first open data actors in the region was the Geographical Information Centre Lounaispaikka. Therefore, when the open data spearhead project began in 2014, it was an obvious choice for the city of Turku to invite Lounaispaikka to collaborate in the open data distribution and management. In addition, the city of Turku invited Turku Science Park to the project. The common goal of these actors was to activate businesses to utilize data opened by the city of Turku and other public sector organizations. The city of Turku as an open data provider needs also more specific information of what kind of data would interest the developers and enterprisers most. That information could be reached only in business interactions.

The regional open data clearing house – Lounaistieto.fi – was published by Lounaispaikka in autumn 2015. Lounaistieto.fi provides a data portal, map application and many other tools for a wide and vivid open data community. The community is growing quickly within the city, but also in the region as the Regional council of Southwest Finland, the host organization of Lounaispaikka, has marketed open data activities for the smaller municipalities in the region.

Although building up an open data community has been fast in Southwest Finland, many challenges remain:
- How to create more data-driven businesses?
- Which are the best ways to find individual developers and to help them create new startup firms?
- How to overcome the uncertainties that some public officials seem to have concerning open data?
- How to find the most concrete examples of the benefits of open data and how to use the language everyone can understand (when we speak of open data)?
- How to fulfil the special requirements of the universities regarding open data clearing house?

From the beginning, co-operation has been strongly emphasized in the Turku region – within the region, with other cities and also internationally through the network of Open and Agile Smart Cities. In Southwest Finland we believe that the regional co-operation is an ideal way to start an open data initiative as it brings together all interested actors and involves them to the common open data goals. This collaborative organization also ensures that open data will become widely available from number of different actors.

We look forward to share our experiences in the conference and to get many new ideas from the global open data community.","(1)action

"A lot of effort has been put into developing open data standards for a number of sectors. Linked Open Data Researches are advocating for the adoption of semantic web standards by government data holders. There is a wealth of documents with open data guidelines, handbooks, methodologies, good practices, etc.

But reality is that a big number of the datasets that are being released in open data portals are not useful for reuse for a number of reasons (some below):
1. No timestamps in records in the datasets that make very difficult to track updates
2. Not standard date formats
3. No documentation on the content of fields and datasets
4. Inconsistency in periodic dataset updates
5. No unique identifiers in records
6. No explicit SLA, good or bad, but at least existing
7. ...

And most of these issues would be very easy to fix.

There is a need for plain and simple standards (\""soft standards\""), in many cases just coming from common and well-known database standard practices that for some reason are being ignored by open data portals.

It\'d be better to put some effort in these housekeeping issues rather than in developing more fancy standards. Otherwise, reusers will continue to put their effort in scrapping websites rather than reusing datasets from open data portals.","(1)action

"The global civic and open data community is often hampered by a lack of simple standards for interaction between tools and services. Informed by our experience over the last decade developing CKAN, OpenSpending, and other data-driven projects, we at Open Knowledge International are keenly aware that there is too much friction involved in working with data. Through this work, we have identified a clear need for a lightweight but extensible format for packaging data for publication and installation. Getting these elements of the global data infrastructure right can dramatically reduce the friction experienced by those who work heavily with data resulting in massively improved data quality, utilization, and sharing. We are focusing our current efforts on addressing these elements and believe the time is right for Frictionless Data.

Frictionless Data is a project which focuses on developing a set of tools, standards, and best practices for publishing data. The heart of Frictionless Data is the Data Package standard, a containerization format for any kind of data based on existing practices for publishing open-source software.

The frictions we seek to remove---in getting, sharing, and validating data---stop people from truly benefiting from the wealth of data being opened up every day. They kill the cycle of find-improve-share that makes for a dynamic and productive data ecosystem. The idea behind Frictionless Data is to decouple data publishers and consumers and make it easier to build a standard input/output mechanism for tools and services without necessitating a change in file format: publishers can publish their data as a Data Package and consumers will be able to easily load that package into their favorite tool.

Our overall mission is to make it easier to develop tools and services for working with data and also to ensure greater interoperability between new and existing tools and services. In piloting our approach, we are placing a particular emphasis on supporting researchers in addressing their data needs across various scientific disciplines. We are also developing Fiscal Data Package, an extension of the Data Package format specifically for describing financial data. We are committed to further developing these standards and tools, but also to engaging, evangelizing and building adoption around these concepts.","(1)action

"Especially in the context of the Sustainable Development Goals (and their 169 targets), the perception of the demand for open data has never been higher. There are high level panels, working groups, national plans, all pronouncing that we need to put data in people’s hands. We share this planet with over 7 billion humans, yet only a small portion are active users of open data. There is not a clear global picture of the people not using data and the reasons why they do not or cannot use open data.

While the Open Data roadmap contains activities around researching who uses open data (and how), I will argue that we also need to ask ourselves who does not use open data. Drawing on a wide range of literature from library studies, information studies, behavioural economics, design ethnography and development studies, this talk will propose a strategy to:

Understand who is not accessing open data currently
Define the barriers that limit their access
Assess the impact of internet-enabled mobile phones as an actant in decision-making systems
Propose principles to match people that could benefit from open data with the right data sources

I will start with existing research in the open data movement about users. This includes work under the Open Data Research Network and discussions around Principles 3 and 6 of the Open Data Charter, as well as work on the theme of ‘Accessible Data’ under the UN Data Revolution Group.

I will then outline theories about ‘non-users’, especially Greger (2010), and a range of literature explaining motivations behind decision-making and human behaviour. My call to action is to apply these theories to better understand the reasons for non-use of open data - whether that’s material, social or psychological - and assess their impact on its uptake and use in different contexts across the world. In particular it will be useful to investigate the internet-enabled mobile phone as an actant within decision-making systems, and whether that facilitates the introduction of open data into people’s lives.

There are two key groups this research would investigate. First are people who are just gaining access to or will soon be able to access the internet for the first time, because they have an internet-enabled phone. Second are those ‘left behind’ because of various barriers (cost, infrastructure, education etc) that limit access to open data. Both groups are essential to target if we want to achieve sustainable development. They are often the most vulnerable or most affected by social, economic and environmental issues, but are also close enough to many problems to mean small actions could combine to deliver massive achievements.

The impact of this research would be fundamental for driving new areas of innovation in the delivery of open data, as it should highlight the key barriers currently limiting successful sharing. Thus it should help meet overarching goals of the open data community, to provide much more information to many more people, helping us all to help build the world we want.","(1)action

"Policy coherence and multi-stakeholders’ engagement across all levels of government are crucial to translate global commitments on Open Data into noticeable economic and social benefits for local communities. The United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals call for policy coherence between governments’ international commitments and national policies and actions; and the International Open Data Charter (IODC) demands countries to implement coherent policies and actions towards the co-creation of public value in collaboration with national stakeholders. Under this framework, central and local governments have both increasingly designed open government data policies, and embarked on initiatives, that aim to create value across a wide range of policy sectors and for all stakeholders. Unfortunately, these efforts are often uncoordinated and not always coherent.
If ex-ante coordination between central and local governments is not established during the early stages of policy development, there is a greater risk of low policy coherence with a negative effect on multi-level impact and on multi-stakeholder engagement. In fact, policy coherence across levels of government can support collaboration and engagement of the whole open data ecosystem; and sustain crowdsourcing of inputs for better results for local communities. The role of local governments and infomediaries at the local level is crucial to ensure that data demands reach decision makers at the central government level, and also to spot citizen-produced data (online and offline) as a valuable first-hand input for local and central governments’ policies design and as feedback for their assessment and impact measurement.
Yet, it seems that governments are not always ensuring policy coherence across levels of government to better engage local actors (citizens, CSOs, private sector, civil servant, etc.), bring local voices and demands close to central government’s decisions and translate global commitment into local benefits.
This panel will bring together representatives from central and local governments, and different actors of the open data ecosystem, to discuss and foster a better understanding of the following issues:
• How stronger policy coherence across levels of government can help better prioritise decisions and allocation of resources on data release, and can foster collaborative platforms to increase policy impact in collaboration with local actors of the open data ecosystem.
• How to improve multi-stakeholders’ co-ordination and collaboration building on central and local open data policies.
• The role of local governments as ‘intermediaries’ between the central government and local actors of the open data ecosystem, and how this role can contribute to achieving supranational (global) goals.","(1)action

"Mobile communication and devices have raised a series of challenges concerning the delimitation of the public and private, intimate and personal spheres. Specifically, and because of its close connection to the nervous system and emotions, these devices allow a wide variety of affordances while, and in accordance to the broad scope of the previous dimensions, a series of worrying risks – because of the same relationship and interdependence between users’ rational and sensorial sides.
Online communication and user performance in the mobile environment have produced a wide range of possibilities concerning time and space. Within this ever-changing ecosystem of coordinates in real and virtual worlds that are being altered and/or juxtaposed, users seem to experience different kinds of perceptions about what was traditionally considered ‘public, private, intimate and personal’. In this gradation, emotion management and technological literacy appear to play key roles, while concepts like anonymity, authenticity, intimacy, identity or the Self flow intermittently in this media ecology.
Users’ management of content and information, as well as the Self and social networking, have proved to be prominent aspects to consider. On the one hand, the fluidity of identity, cellular and nomadic intimacy, network privatism and the tethered, tutored and quantified Self should be highlighted. On the other hand, continuous partial attention, multitasking and/or multiplexing performance, the relationship between memories and places, the limitation of the impact of users’ knowledge on their actions, strong circumstantial pattern behavior, the relevance of temporal priority in digital literacy and the lack of rationality in some attitudes and performances have become ingrained in users’ behavior online.
Moreover, this media ecology is framed by the ambiguity and volatility of overall ‘personal policies’ and ‘terms and conditions’, which are added the liquidity and mobility of our society and technology itself and the architecture of exposure (of disclosure/intimacy) to the interface design of mobile communication and devices. Therefore, a reflection is proposed on the concepts of ‘liquid spheres’ or ‘constellations’ as a way of describing this dissolution of boundaries.
Furthermore, the (re)construction of the user profile and the digital identity resulting from both conscious and unconscious activity on the Internet is directly linked to the process of creation and diffusion of content. Many times, neither the users-prosumers are aware of this process nor are the authors cognizant of the original content, as new authors – humans as well as machines - cover the relations established between the users, their content, their activity online and the combination of these. Big data and information economy are not just consequences of the possibility of collecting as much information as possible about users. Instead, they provide a quasi unlimited means of mapping and shaping every movement of our behavior and lives through devices and technologies, which may also allow enrichment ways to improve many aspects.
Therefore, it is an urgent need to delve into an international ethic code for the interface design of apps, webs and platforms as well as, specifically, for the mobile devices due to its intrinsic and specific features and characteristics.","(1)action

"Ministry of Public Administration intends to reform the system for publishing open data government and the public sector. Today, users have a highly dispersed and difficult to access the data source, led by the State and the public sector.
Some government bodies have set up their own systems of open data (SORS, EARS NIJZ, SMA, ...) which are not fully open, in accordance with the rules and principles of reuse and very few of those who publish open data portal NIO.
Therefore, the project intends to establish a central point through which the user would have the opportunity to see what the database to be kept in the country are available for re-use, read their descriptions and metadata associated with each source database.
The ultimate goal of the project is to overhaul the system for publishing open data portal and the establishment of open data Slovenia, which will be the central point of access to various databases in machine-readable form.
To achieve this objective it will be necessary to establish a strategy for opening data to determine the contents of the portal, renovate technology platform, edit the relevant legislation and change the culture of accessing information.
In addition to the renovation of the technical platform, we would also upgrade the editorial aspect. To facilitate the editorial work, we will prepare an action plan and a manual how to opening the data.","(1)action

"The OpenDataLabs concept aims at showing the potential of open data to citizens, by creating open innovation playgrounds where urban stakeholders can collaborate to generate applications that meet the needs of the citizens and make a positive contribution to their everyday life. The model of the OpenDataLab, which is being currently developed in the EC-funded project Open4Citizens (http://www.open4citizens.eu/), is a virtual and physical place where interested parties can find methodologies, connections and resources to generate new solutions based on open data. Likewise Fablabs, which are disclosing new opportunities for bottom-up production by manipulating materials, the OpenDataLab discloses new opportunities in re-using open data.

The OpenDataLabs are being defined and implemented in five European cities (Barcelona, Milano, Rotterdam, Karlstad and Copenhagen) through a series of citizen involvement events or hackathons. These hackathon cycles will involve several stakeholders, including citizens, communities, grassroots groups, students, start-up companies and representatives from public institutions or service providers. Together they will work on co-creating new solutions for existing or future services based on the use of data. A dedicated open-source platform will enable non-technical-savvy citizens to explore, process and visualize open data that are relevant to their problems and concerns. The open data that will be made available to the citizens at each location include -but are not limited to- the data coming from the existing networks of devices, sensors and microcomputers part of our city infrastructures, and the user-generated data deriving from the citizens’ voluntary publication of information, positioning data or other personal data.

The outcome of the Open4Citizens project is therefore the conceptual definition and methodological underpinnings of the OpenDataLab playground, and a proof of concept consisting of the innovative solutions generated in the hackathons. The OpenDataLab model is an integrated system of engagement, participation and co-design tools that will support the cooperation between the various stakeholders. The social impact of the OpenDataLab does not just lay on the individual solutions to specific urban problems developed at the hackathons, but also in the reduced distance between open data and citizens: increasingly data are available and more citizens are empowered to use them.","(1)action

"From Twitter to the World Bank, the data revolution is transforming business as usual. Everything from our spending habits to our health status is now captured in data form. The field of analytics is converting information about us into a most valuable global currency through the rise of the big data movement. Moreover, government, industry, and NGO’s alike are increasingly aspiring to data ideals. With 90% of data in the world created in the last two years alone, we are undoubtedly in the data age. Yet, this unparalleled profusion of data is not universal.

Marginalized populations across the globe continue to face glaring data inequities. Indigenous peoples, for example, contend with a dearth of relevant information about their populations despite enduring generations of contentious data collection efforts in their communities. A discussion about the implications of the open data movement for Indigenous communities worldwide is long overdue. The open data movement has both benefits and potential drawbacks for Indigenous populations. On the one hand, it can be used to better inform policy and the allocation of resources and protections, as well as support an evidence based vision for Indigenous communities. On the other hand, open data is accompanied by numerous challenges and concerns pertaining to privacy and Indigenous information rights.

In this light, the Indigenous Open Data Summit pre-event of the IODC 2016 will be the first opportunity for international Indigenous data users, producers, and community members to come together to discuss critical questions pertaining to Indigenous peoples and open data. These include: What data do we make open? How? To whom will they be opened? How do we balance the opportunities inherent in the open data movement with protections for Indigenous peoples? Developing international principles for Indigenous open data involves thinking deeply about critical issues such as digital divides, privacy, and the protection of Indigenous knowledge.

A draft Indigenous Open Data Charter, developed as a collaborative effort among all Indigenous data stakeholders present, is a primary outcome of the Indigenous Open Data Summit IODC pre-event. It is our intention to present this draft Indigenous Open Data Charter to the full IODC as part of an action panel. This panel will serve to solicit feedback and guidance from international open data experts as to how the draft Indigenous Open Data Charter can align with the aims and intent of the recent International Open Data Charter.","(1)action

"I have been studying open data initiatives in Colombia since 2009. Since I am a journalists, I have also studied how those amazing sources of information can help journalism and media become more innovative, informative and useful for societies. So, I started giving workshops on this topic for reporters in my country in 2011.

I have discovered that local journalists don\'t take advantage open data tools such as government online databases because they don\'t know they exist or haven\'t developed the skills to understand and use those tools. So I have directed my training programs to raise those skills and show journalists how open data can make their work easier and with a higher impact.

The results are evident: when you teach journalists how to access public information via FOIA requests or via open data tools, they start producing investigations that better inform societies, news apps that let people know the real background of their favorite candidates in political elections, reports that demand more accountability from governments or analyze public contracts, stories that help people find the more convenient places to live, etc.

Therefor, I believe our Capacity Building Action Track should definitely involve training for journalists and media, since they are a powerful bridge for letting communities benefit from open data.","(1)action

"Web 2.0 and innovation in information technology sparked the emergence of terms like Disaster Relief 2.0, Revolution 2.0, and Control 2.0 and its relationship to natural and human caused emergencies, the traditional and new stakeholders, technologies used, and the challenges and opportunities that they induce. During recent emergencies, various online communities have supported the affected population by aggregating data, launching online campaigns, mobilizing and allocating resources, and spreading the news.

Most natural crises happen suddenly and for responders it also comes with an extra dilemma: collecting current data to fully understand the phenomenon and the urgency of immediate response. To fully understand the situation and make effective decisions, current and accurate information has to be available. In most cases, current and accurate information is a luxury that humanitarians do not have. The regions that they have to support already lack the capabilities and communication infrastructure to run relief operations, which stimulates the usability and power of the crowd-sourced and open data.

Recent crisis data management has introduced new players and new techniques, which were accompanied by new challenges. In the past few decades, crises have become global and have triggered international intervention, which has brought challenges in data production, management, and sharing. The coordination management of Haiti’s 2010 crisis marked a significant transitional stage in humanitarian aid history. Not only because of the involvement of the Volunteer and Technical Communities (V&TCs) and use of social networks, but also due to the global collaboration of all humanitarian aid providers and volunteers in the cybersphere and on the ground. Using the latest technologies and Web 2.0 services, the V&TCs poured the information they organized from thousands of sources into the hands of responders who had limited capacity to receive such a massive amount of information.

Though the collaboration between the UN organizations, donors, NGOs, governments, volunteers, and local communities was extraordinary, it created new bottlenecks and shed light on many communication gaps that, if addressed, could make crisis management more effective.

Building on the IODC Action Plan for International Collaboration and specifically the sections on shared principles for open data and development of good practices and standards, I propose adding more recommendations for open data in emergency management. Those recommendations are related to the use of technology to facilitate information gathering, verification, structuring, communication, and sharing. These recommendations can be presented under three categories: information producers and users, communication channels and technologies, and information structure and standards. In addition, I suggest recommendations related to the management of qualitative data collected through social media and the interrelationships between big events, humans, information, politics, and technology.

"Considering openness and transparency in public administrations as a condition to develop society.
Considering that local public administrations are the closest ones to the citizenship and the ones which are going to solve and be asked for solving problems to neighborhood.
Considering the bottom-up effect, to set solutions and development strategies from the basis close to the citizen up to the mayor administrations…set solutions and project from local to national and global.
We must realize that openness and transparency become useless if they are not offering right. It could be even dangerous if it is tried to hide public corruption and bad performances by giving huge mountains of papers that requires hundreds of people reading paper by paper….is that transparency? …or just trying to avoid transparency? Establishing Exclusive Institutions?...
In this point Open Data achieve a decisive importance as it is the main way to get transparency become real and useful…by offering public information in a automatically machine-readable way.
By let citizenship access to public administration we empower people and strength institutions and getting social and economic development. We success in achieving Inclusive Institutions, open to the people.
If we want to get real transparency and openness it is necessary to foster open data systems in public administrations as a guarantee of true transparency.
Public information must be ready to read, use and work it immediately and up-to-date continuously. Otherwise it is not true transparency and become useless.
To solve problems, create business opportunities and improve government using transparency Open Data is the proper tool.
Open data has mix spirit as it is an attitude to implement in local governments but to expand out all over the world…that is why we call it GLOCAL. Act local but thinking globally.
Furthermore, Open data is based on a “knowledge economy” up to be used and replicate all over the world.
Open data as a tool working for transparency improve government, solve problems, empower citizens and create business opportunities.
The context to use open data is local as it could be used to develop local services as traffic, transport, urban development, water supply, electoral process but also global as those all services are similar in every public administration all over the world.
There are numerous opportunities in Open data and the interested audience is anyone worried about achieving true transparency in public administration.
Our challenge is to realized that open data is the best way to achieve real openness and set it up in public administrations by preparing principles and policies in order to implement it.","(1)action

"In 2016 Open Government will be one of the priorities of the new administration at Buenos Aires Province, Argentina. The Subsecretary of State Modernization, through the Open Government Unit, will be responsible for the implementation of the Open Gov plan.
Buenos Aires Province is the main subnational district, it concentrates a third of the population of Argentina (as much as Chile´s) and 38% of the country´s GDP.
Due to the fact that we conceive Open Government as a fundamental engine for innovation not only for the state but also for the society, it will be set as a main axis of our government.
Empowered citizens, transparency and innovation will be the main goals of the Open Gov iniciative. The Province will adopt the Open Data Charter and guarantee the openness following the six principles: Open by default, Timely and comprehensive, Accesible and Usable, Comparable and Interoperable, for improved Governance and Citizen Engagement, for inclusive development and innovation.
As part of this strategy, we will issue an Open Gov decree that will urge all the ministries to release data following open data standards and specifying expected dates of release. For the first time in Buenos Aires we´ll implement the Open Data Plattform that will concentrate all the information about the Province. As we think that public employees are the keys to ensure openness over the future Open Gov will be teached to more than 10,000 employees.
There will be a special program aimed to the 135 local governments of the Province called “Buenos Aires Open” to encourage openness all over the biggest district of Argentina. Buenos Aires will have a special team to provide technical assistance to develop Open Gov & Data policies.
We aim to promote open gov over all government levels and work together with the comunity by organizing camps, hackathons and open innovation contests.

"During the last years local, regional and national governments are acquiring a strong commitment to a horizontal strategy of their performances called Open Government. This idea of governance is based on policies which promote public administration transparency, open data and citizens’ interaction in decision-making processes and ongoing collaboration through bottom-up strategies.
The transition from a passive to an active citizenship requires information and communications technologies. Thereby, the vast majority of public administrations try to improve citizen information through portals Transparency and Participation. In this context, the Open Data appears whose philosophy is to promote free access to public sector data so they can be reused by others to attract and serve citizens, businesses and any other institution.
The main objective of this study is (i) to obtain a real and updated vision about the status of initiatives of Open Data in the local administration of Spanish cities; (ii) to identify best practices within their efforts and strategies through a depth analysis of the characteristics of their open data official websites; (iii) to demonstrate gaps as lack of standardization or homogeneous structure and lack of common strategy between different administrations to publish data openly; (iv) to assess the quality of open data regarding incorrect formats, useless or outdated data that do not meet the requirements to qualify them as open data; (v) to help them to prepare and improve their open data strategy.
Thereby, it assesses best portals to understanding which data is more valuable and which are the techniques and technologies more adequate to both data scientists use and regular citizen use.
Spain is moving towards the transparent and sustainable city based on the Smart City approach. Kontinakis and Katalin, 2015, proved on their city council surveys that the main challenges that cities are dealing in the open data processes in Europe are:
• Financial and human resources
• Datasets collaborations
• Standards
• Business cases related with open data
• Best practices
In the same document, they also agree that stakeholders and citizens are basic elements to a smart city project.
This study aims to highlight Spanish and international best practices not only in open data but also in open government from the citizen and stakeholders perspective.
This study also aims to understand what the principles tendencies for an open smart government strategy are to assessment from the citizen point of view.","(1)action

"As the 2015 IODC Conference Report stated, ‘too often the potential of open data is hindered by poor application of common standards and good practices for data licensing, file formats, publication patterns, documentation, and data schema. Data publishers should focus on meeting minimum good practices and increasing the quality and interoperability of their data as quickly as possible.’

The W3C Data on the Web Best Practices (DWBPs) provide practical guidance related to the publication and usage of data on the Web designed to help support a self-sustaining ecosystem https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/ Data should be discoverable and understandable by humans and machines. Where data is used in some way, whether by the originator of the data or by an external party, such usage should also be discoverable and the efforts of the data publisher recognized. In short, following these best practices will facilitate interaction between publishers and consumers.

The DWBPs have been developed to encourage and enable the continued expansion of the Web as a medium for the exchange of data. The growth of open data by governments across the world, the increasing publication of research data, the harvesting and analysis of social media, the crowd-sourcing of information, the provision of important cultural heritage collections, and the sustained growth in the Linked Open Data Cloud, provide some examples of this phenomenon.

The openness and flexibility of the Web creates new challenges for data publishers and data consumers, such as how to represent, describe and make data available in a way that it will be easy to find and to understand. In contrast to conventional databases, data on the Web allows for the existence of multiple ways to represent and to access data. In this context, it becomes crucial to provide guidance to publishers that will improve consistency in the way data is managed, thus promoting the reuse of data and also to foster trust in the data among developers, whatever technology they choose to use, increasing the potential for genuine innovation.

The DWBPs cover the following areas:
• Metadata
• Data Licenses
• Data Provenance
• Data Quality
• Data Versioning
• Data Identifiers
• Data Formats
• Data Vocabularies
• Sensitive Data
• Data Access
• Data Preservation
• Feedback
• Data Enrichment
• Data Reuse

The benefits of applying the Best Practices are:
• Comprehension: humans will have a better understanding about the data structure, the data meaning, the metadata and the nature of the dataset.
• Processability: machines will be able to automatically process and manipulate the data within a dataset.
• Discoverability machines will be able to automatically discover a dataset or data within a dataset.
• Reuse: the chances of dataset reuse by different groups of data consumers will increase.
• Trust: the confidence that consumers have in the dataset will improve.
• Linkability: it will be possible to create links between data resources (datasets and data items).
• Access: humans and machines will be able to access up to date data in a variety of forms.
• Interoperability: it will be easier to reach consensus among data publishers and consumers.","(1)action

"Two years ago, Elliot Ramos, journalist from @ChicagoEl, wrote the 8th chapter of the amazing book Beyond Transparency, Open data and the future of civic innovation titled A Journalist’s Take on Open Data. This essay says open data is a very important tool to make good journalism. Besides the fact that journalists usually work with data, some of them get surprised about the term data journalism. However, data journalism is not the same as working with data. It is true that they comb financial report to pump out quarterly earnings or interpret annual country budgets. Ramos points out that most of the times media agencies provide executive summaries, bullet points and numbers broken out into figures than can be turned around on deadline easily, but there is a lack of skills at maths or computing that can keep journalists one step behind the breaking news.
Those who have improved their skills or those who come from other areas as computing or data analysis are able to “break away from the day-to-day rush of breaking news and concentrate on a story to extrapolate the information and get to the underlying reasons for a policy being enacted”, Ramos adds.
But let’s walk one step backwards before covering data analysis. One of the tasks where journalists usually get stuck and spend a lot of time in is collecting documents, records, data. This is even harder in countries like Spain, where freedom of information or transparency laws are just born and most of data published is poor and inconsistent. Sometimes, data collection is a kind of nightmare. This is the reason why some journalists, data journalists, are also open data advocates.
Journalists can analyze data and benefit from Open Government Data, but they also have to receive training and education on working with new tools, analytics, and large data. Sometimes, they can be helped by researchers, database analysts, statistics, data analysts or social scientists in making sense of government reports, budgets, and almost everything that is patiently obtained via Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests.
Unfortunately, most of the times reporters will wait tirelessly for a FOIA request only to get a PDF file, including an image exported from a DOC file, probably protected and useless, instead of an electronic file of structured data, fully accessible… let’s get to the point, journalists need open data. If they do not use it, they will need to increase scraping routines, as they currently do.
Fortunately, the access to some of that information is now changing. Journalists can create stories or even news applications that sometimes can improve the utility of the open data portals they feed.
Furthermore, data journalists usually track their work and share it in some ways as The Guardian Datablog would do and some other news projects usually do. So, my aim is to create an open data standard for data journalism, investigative journalists or journalists interested in Open Data Journalism.","(1)action

"This talk will outline the benefits of using an open data standard for amplifying the utility of public financial management data - using the example of open public procurement data in Ukraine.

When ProZorro adopted OCDS as operational language of eProcurement, publishing standard and data interchange format, we did not envision all possibilities that well engineered data standard brings. The core capability of OCDS is ability to enrich data corpus with extra properties added as extensions. Final data corpus is formed from many so called releases that can come in different moments of time (capturing data changes over time) from different sources, with different levels of trust in data published. These releases allow data correction, enriching and annotation.

This is simplified approach for open data linking, since there are standard tools for release merging and processing. From technology standpoint different data sources are linked around several core building blocks of OCDS: project, plan, tender and contract. If there are any data source that has information about any of the entities mentioned above, having OCDS data production guidelines, it is rather trivial to produce OCDS release that enriches entity with extra properties from the additional data source.

Risk management, monitoring and scoring systems can utilize core OCDS data set and any additional sources producing OCDS releases. The important part for the process is to republish results of this scoring, monitoring and risk management systems as Open Data, and formatted as OCDS release.

These risk management outputs can be reused by crowd sourced field monitoring tools to emphasize the plans, tenders, contract, that allows to focus efforts on areas needing attention. And again these field monitoring tools should republish their results in OCDS release format back for all other OCDS capable tools to reuse: Visualization, Business Intelligence, Risk Management, etc.

This kind of iterative improvement of quality of information can be called Open Data amplification, and core component of the approach is standardized publishing of Open Data (in case described above the standard is OCDS - Open Contracting Data Standard).","(1)action

"Sector-based OpenData response Program as envisioned have two key objective towards enhancing participation and capacity of Open Data Leaders in and Outside Government. It is grounded in strongly in Knowledge sharing and collaborative framework strategies that look to bring together impactful data ideas and working together to archive and discover more.

The first objective at a basic level is to enhance the utilization of data within government by building capacity around digitization, data storage and archival, visualization, analytics and enable the construction of Dashboards to inform Decisions and actions. It encompasses our origins in the collection of data and storage and moves to turn data into actionable insight that government bodies could use to enhance their operation.


The second objective is to evaluate data needs within specific sectors of the society and based on these requirements form a neutral nonpartisan space where Government can actively engage the private sector, civil society and its citizenry towards archiving enhanced access to information and data for specific Sector needs. This objective specifically targets bringing together new data beyond government and applying technology based solutions to fill the data gaps. Model Global examples of this can be seen in initiatives such as the Open Traffic that build open source tools for the transport sector. In the Kenyan Context our OData Reponses Program targeted opening up information in the security sector by providing access to crime reports and directly feeding this information to the Nyumba Kumi Initiative (neighborhood policing) enabling small neighborhoods to better rapidly respond to rising crime levels in their areas with situational awareness information. This approach calls for strategic long-term engagement beyond publishing data to identifying available data sources in and outside government and combining these to activate data with multiplier benefits for the industry and society.","(1)action

"Open data and the reuse of public sector information (RPSI) are two essential concepts in the path towards Smart Cities and Open Government. On the one hand, the opening up of data as applied to public sector data recognises and is the result of the right of the general public, businesses and society at large to access publicly owned information. Furthermore, it enables transparency mechanisms to be implemented and makes it possible for the general public to participate and collaborate, thereby promoting a more efficient democratic system. On the other hand, reusing the information produced by public administrations promotes the development of new digital products and services, energising economic and business activity, and ultimately providing value for the general public.

Given the recognised benefits and legislative requirements, public Administrations and entities require guidelines that establish criteria, concepts and metrics, all favouring regulatory simplification.

This standard, agreed by all interested and involved parties, was established as a proven tool to support public Administrations and entities. It includes technical specifications based on the results of experience and technological development.

This standard will facilitate the systematisation of open data projects and improve their management. It is primarily intended to be a reference in the hands of public Administrations and entities to help define, document and implement open data projects.

This standard will assess the level of maturity of an open data project, facilitating its implementation and continuous improvement, and is designed to take into account all aspects affecting and fostering the project\'s sustainability, quality, efficiency and efficacy. It will also help the public to have a clear and quantified image of the opening up of data as managed by the public sector Administrations and entities governing the city.

UNE 178301. Open Data in Smart Cities. Objective and Scope of Application:
This standard establishes how to assess the publication of a City\'s Open Data. It is determined in the form of metrics and an indicator to measure the degree of maturity of open data created or held by the public sector that may be reused in the scope of Smart Cities.

"Open budgets and Participatory budgeting are very popular topics among Open Data researchers and government officials (even in Russia). It allows to make government more transparent. Publishing of budgets are important for national and local level. For example Open Budget Index (of IBP) measures quality of budget publishing of countries. In Russia more then 80 regions and 20 000 municipalities. Open Budget Index include only 1 budget of Russia. What about others? What do you know about other Russian budgets? Could you understand them? Publishing of budget data (all levels) in well-structured and machine-readable format is a real tool for building democracy and involving citizens in the budget process. There are standards for transport data (GTFS), city issues (Open311) and etc. But no such format for budgets. We investigated a lot of budgets of different countries and suggest as a solution \""Open Budget Format (OBF)\"". This is customizable format that include some specific questions (like amendments, different structure and levels, budget docs, reports and etc) that allow to publish budgets of any countries easy, for any levels and then match different budget data each other or with government contracts and etc. So we need unified standard for budget information that also will be compatible with all well-known financial data standards (like OCDS for contracts, COFOG, IMF, OKFN, etc).

"eGovernance has been evolving over the decade. Having acknowledged the presence of web and conveying relevant information to the public i.e the Information stage, the next stage of Interaction has given the citizens the ability to deal with the government saving time and making relationships. In many countries the eGovernance systems have evolved to levels where transactions in their entirety can be competed without having to leave the comfort of one’s home or office. However, if the ultimate goal is to save time, simplifying processes and drive up efficiencies, the challenge of dealing with multiple entities and contacts need to be resolved. Societal and democratic processes cannot be built on anonymity or moving targets. A one point of contact saves money and time as well as boosts the satisfaction of customers along with productivity. National Identification Systems or online systems that can meet such requirements can play an important role in the “Transformation” of eGovernance.
From a sustainability view point, there are large scale Economic and Social impact to the countries that are planning or currently undergoing implementation of such a system. In 2007, there were over 43 countries across the world, either developed or less developed that have implemented such system or are in the process of doing so. Today there are approximately 103 countries that have deployed some kind of government issued identification system. When large scale deployment of such system that incur substantial costs in the range billions of dollars, require a supporting legal policy, social acceptance, and have deep impact on human liberties, the sustainable aspects of such schemes require critical attention.","(1)action

After 3 years of such experimentation, a joint experience with other peer organizations (suchh as Open Knowledge Foundation, Internews and ODI) is needed to reflect on lessons learned on capacity building approaches, learning success assessment and scalability models at an international and local level.","(1)action

"Transparency is a key objective for public sector innovation and an important element for open governance. After the first wave of establishing open government data portals and partnership, followed by a second way of developing apps are for enabling transparency. The objective of this paper is to analyze the relationship between the opening of data and transparency. Open data is conceptualized as a process consisting of storing, publishing, distribution, processing and visualizing which should result in transparency. The research approach of this article is based on the case study that creates a selected indexes based on what the literature review of international standards for the governance of cities recommends, such as the ISO 9001:2000 in local government, ISO 37120 and Social Progress Index (SPI). These common indexes will be tested on 3 different cities across United States, considered the potential places with more open data disclosed at open data portal.

Also here we would propose to interchange different practices in Open data and databases that exist in some countries and not in others.

Standards In the Infomediary world, the economic financial sector is not directly represented on the provisional list of Open Data Areas. We propose to speak about the importance of this sector and the generation a specific area that’s oriented around the business world (Open data for business information), in which the Public Administration manages the data as a source for creating new products and infomediary services, concerning solvency, business risk management, trends, perspectives, SWOT (Strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats), economic value, sources etc. Interchanging ideas internationally. In other countries, how does the facilitation of greater transparency in the market work? Is the reuse of tax, registration, or other data held by public administrations in an open format permitted? We propose to reflect the value of open data in this area to commercial traffic and the best way is to measure the infomediary sector. Are there studies like the which of ASEDIE that measure the value of infomediary sector in other countries? It would be interesting to see the evolution in Europe and other countries worldwide. From our point of view, we see that this area is not only linked to every other area but is an integral part of their growth. This area is also of vital importance in the prevention and/ or control of Criminal Offences (money laundering, terrorist financing, corruption) fraud prevention. Highlighting the Safety and prevention tools. This area by contextualization, debugging and analysis creates confidence, commercial security and economic development. Justifying the existence of this area and easiness of opening public sector data to improve commercial traffic. The impact session will focus on the impact with concrete examples that this area has had in the business world and general society and therefore why it should be included as an area in itself.

"We propose to reflect the value of open data to commercial traffic and the best way is to measure the value. Are there studies like the which of ASEDIE that measure the value of infomediary sector in other countries? It would be interesting to see the evolution internationally In the knowledge economy in which we live, the companies forming part of ASEDIE are aware of the importance of the re-use of Public Sector Information, which can be assumed as a crucial element to generating value and wealth, business and job growth and stability in the immediate future. Having rich, objective information that has been treated properly can raise the level of transparency in business. This increased transparency fosters several beneficial effects on the economy: - Increased confidence - Increased projection - More efficient companies - More resistant business network. The services and products created by the infomediary industry are used by hundreds of companies, self-employed and individuals in the international market as an indispensable tool for the development of its activities. Throughout the last decade, the products offered by the infomediary sector have become a vital part of transactions, providing the values and the necessary legal certainty that allow other agents to operate with the precision, safety and diligence that the market demands. The information provided by open data is used by business` for statistical studies on the socioeconomic reality.

By having a better understanding of the needs of society the business network can develop their activities in a viable and sustainable way over time. We would like to draw attention and raise the awareness of reuse possibilities, noting that the lack of information permits us from using other important indicators. The value is based on creating products and services that \'bring knowledge to the market and the citizen.\' Information is vital in a rapidly changing and competitive environment like the present. Infomediary companies, in concrete Business Economical - Financial Sector by reusing information create products and services that facilitate decision making.
